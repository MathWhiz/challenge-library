  description: |-
      Dwarf Fortress is a single-player fantasy game that revolves around a randomly-generated world, and includes three modes:  
      
      * Dwarf Fortress Mode, in which you manage a group of dwarves in a small location
      * Adventure Mode, in which you explore the entire world with a party
      * Legends, in which you read about your world's history
      
      It is historically known for its steep learning curve, due to it's random nature and it's complex systems. Let's play it!
