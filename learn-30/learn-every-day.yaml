        ====
        This challenge, *originally* inspired by the [Productivityist](https://productivityist.com) article \"[How To Learn Something New Every Day (And Actually Do Something With It)](https://productivityist.com/how-to-learn-something-new-every-day/)\" (not required reading), is designed to help you learn something new **of your choosing** every day for 30 days, and share it with the guild.
        
        In order to be eligible for the prize, you must:
        1. Fill out the [Google Form](FORMLINK)
        2. Post to your output at least **seven** times
        3. Share what you learned directly to the guild at least **once** 
        
        The Dailies will be active from STARTDATE to ENDDATE, after which the Challenge will be judged. However, you can start any time after you join this Challenge.
